## Inspiration
It's not really an inspiration🤪, it's just that when I searched for themes on the official [website](https://themes.gohugo.io/) of hugo themes, I found that they didn't provide a corresponding api. So I made my own theme list sorted by the number of stars.

Contributions must be available on a separately named branch based on the latest version of the main branch.
